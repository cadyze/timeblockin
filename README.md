This is a program that allows you to utilize Google's Gemini to split a given goal into manageable tasks throughout your week. Simply type in the goal you want to achieve by the end of the week and press generate to see how the AI would split it so that you can have the highest probabliity to succeed. It will avoid any time conflicts with other events.

## Timeline
